## Introduction

Open Data or Public Sector Information Openness is a movement driven by public administrations with the main objective of maximizing available public resources, exposing the information generated or guarded by public bodies, allowing its access and use for the common good and the benefit of anyone and any entity interested.

Open Data BCN, a project that was born in 2010, implementing the portal in 2011, has evolved and is now part of the Barcelona Ciutat Digital strategy, fostering a pluralistic digital economy and developing a new model of urban innovation based on the transformation and digital innovation of the public sector and the implication among companies, administrations, the academic world, organizations, communities and people, with clear public and citizen leadership. 

Nevertheless, it is in continuous evolution and there is a massive potential for interrelating different online resources for data consultation and its visualization without the need for diving deep into the data. In other words, this large amount of information could always be present but in a more convenient, illustrative and interactive way to catch and retain the attention of the data consumer, while providing powerful insights.

After exploring one of the online resources (https://www.barcelona.cat/es/vivir-en-bcn/vive-el-barrio), it was clear that the user experience overall was quite exceptional as it incorporates an interactive map of the city of Barcelona which directs the user to the description page of each neighbourhood. However, this could improve by adding some general information and present it through multiple dashboards that provide relevant indicators of the socio-economical reality of the population located there.

## Objective

Based on tthe previous assumption, I have chosen 5 datasets provided by Barcelona's City Hall Open Data Service, which includes relevant information updated to 2020 segregated by the district and neighbourhood of the population of the city of Barcelona they live in, on subjects such as:

Academic qualifications
Employment and unemployment demand registered by month
Nationality, origin region and age 

After an ETL process, the ultimate goal is to create multiple dashboards in Tableau to present a dynamic and interactive digital product that they could be incorporated in each description page to maximize the value provided to the final user.

## Data Description

The datasets used for this project are:

- Population of the city of Barcelona by sex and academic level
- Population of the city of Barcelona according to sex, five-year age and nationality
- Population of the city of Barcelona according to sex and place of birth
- Population of the city of Barcelona according to sex and nationality
- Registered unemployement in the city of Barcelona.

The data extracted were in Catalan and has been translated to English for a universal purpose. There are approximately more than 21800 records in total to nurture this project, after cleaning and normalizing the variables, it has been collected in just one single table to facilitate the visualization task.

## Deliverables

- 6 interactive Dashboards that presents the information in a clear and user-friendly way to the final consumer.
